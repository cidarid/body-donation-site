              Learning from human specimens makes a significant educational impact on students training to be healthcare
              professionals. Students develop a strong skill set and hands on anatomical training from which essential
              knowledge about the human body grows. Nine out of ten UBC MD graduates who completed their residency at
              UBC end up practicing in BC, giving back to our local communities.

                Body donors provide a service to future generations that carries on long after they have passed. Their
                thoughtful choice provides students and practicing health care professionals with an invaluable
                experience that can not be replicated by a video or captured in a text book.<br /><br />Those who learn
                from our donors are grateful for the unique opportunity they have to work with a human body. They are
                aware of the obligation to conduct themselves in a professional manner and those who donate their bodies
                to the medical school can be assured that all human remains are handled with the dignity and respect
                that should be afforded to anyone.</span
