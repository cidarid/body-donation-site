          The body is the greatest teacher, and it has a story to tell. It teaches students an incredible lesson about
          life that a textbook can never replace. Students always remember that remarkable moment in the anatomy lab,
          beginning with their very first donor, when they learned to respect and honour the human body.<br /><br />You
          can make a meaningful contribution by donating your body to the UBC Faculty of Medicine. The Body Donation
          Program (BDP) provides real life training to the next generation of doctors, dentists, and health care
          professionals. Body donors are part of a community that selflessly gives back to support anatomical
          education, medical training, and scientific research.

                Respect and dignity are the core principles, understood and reflected, by all members of the Body

                highest degree of care by UBC. Faculty and students embody these principles throughout the educational
                process, resulting in graduates who will honor commitments made when first working with donor bodies
                in the anatomy lab.

                Students express their appreciation of the special privilege granted to them by hosting a beautiful
                memorial ceremony in the fall of every year. Including musical performances and words of gratitude,
                family members and loved ones are invited to honour the donor and share fond memories with speeches
                and unforgettable stories. Favorite pictures and treasured belongings of the donor can be displayed in
                the memory hall for all guests to view. Invitations to the ceremony, held at the Life Sciences Centre
                at UBC, are sent to close family members and next of kin in early August.

              provides learners and health care professionals with an extraordinary learning experience. We train more
              than 1,000 individuals each year, each of whom will have a positive impact on the health and well-being
              of many thousands in the coming decades.<br /><br />Individuals who wish to make a significant
              contribution to the program can choose to donate indefinitely, a portion of their body may be retained
              to benefit all students of anatomy for years to come. You can be assured that your donation will be
              handled with the same care and respect that everyone deserves from their health care professionals.
