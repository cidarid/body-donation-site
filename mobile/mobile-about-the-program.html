              Since 1950, the UBC Body Donation Program, rooted from the start in respect and dignity for the donors,
              provides learners and health care professionals with an extraordinary learning experience. We train more
              than 1,000 individuals each year, each of whom will have a positive impact on the health and well-being
              of many thousands in the coming decades.<br /><br />Individuals who wish to make a significant
              contribution to the program can choose to donate indefinitely, a portion of their body may be retained
              to benefit all students of anatomy for years to come. You can be assured that your donation will be
              handled with the same care and respect that everyone deserves from their health care professionals.

            UBC Faculty, students, and trained clinicians use donations for examination and dissection, surgical
            training sessions such as: plastic surgery, orthopedics, gynecology, and emergency medicine,
            and&nbsp;&nbsp;medical research. Upon consent donors also agree to providing specimens for tissue
            sampling, serology testing, and medical imaging of anatomical material. The UBC Body Donation Program does
            not perform autopsiesor disease specific research.

              Students express their appreciation of the special privilege granted to them by hosting a beautiful
              memorial ceremony in the fall of every year. Including musical performances and words of gratitude,
              family members and loved ones are invited to honour the donor and share fond memories with speeches and
              unforgettable stories. Favorite pictures and treasured belongings of the donor can be displayed in the
              memory hall for all guests to view. Invitations to the ceremony, held at the Life Sciences Centre at
              UBC, are sent to close family members and next of kin in early August.

              Respect and dignity are the core principles, understood and reflected, by all members of the Body
              Donation Program team. Beginning with your enrollment, you can be assured that you will be shown the
              highest degree of care by UBC. Faculty and students embody these principles throughout the educational
              process, resulting in graduates who will honor commitments made when first working with donor bodies in
              the anatomy lab.

              “I would like people to know that we&#39;re here for you. If it&#39;s something that you might consider
              for yourself, you think you might like to give back in that way, you probably have some questions about
              how that works, and what happens with your body, and I want people to be reassured.”<br /><br />Matthew
